# Google Datastore Library for PHP #

[Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/) is a great NoSQL solution (hosted, scalable, free up to a point), but it can be tricky (i.e. there's lots of code glue needed) to get even the "Hello World" of data persistence up and running in PHP.

This library is intended to make it easier for you to get started with and to use Datastore in your applications.

## 2.0 Coming Soon ##

Version 2.0 development is well underway, bringing with it performance improvements and access to features like cross-group transactions.

[Take a look at the 2.0 branch](https://github.com/tomwalder/php-gds/tree/2.0)

## Basic Examples ##

I find examples a great way to decide if I want to even try out a library, so here's a couple for you. Check out the examples folder for full code samples.

Firstly, we'll need a `GDS\Store` through which we will read and write `GDS\Entity` objects to and from Datastore. 

The Store needs a `GDS\Gateway` to talk to Google. The gateway needs a `Google_Client` for authentication.

```php
$obj_client = GDS\Gateway::createGoogleClient(APP_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, KEY_FILE);
$obj_gateway = new GDS\Gateway($obj_client, DATASET_ID);
$obj_book_store = new GDS\Store($obj_gateway, 'Book');
```

Create a record and insert into the Datastore (see below for [Alternative Array Syntax](#alternative-array-syntax)) 

```php
$obj_book = new GDS\Entity();
$obj_book->title = 'Romeo and Juliet';
$obj_book->author = 'William Shakespeare';
$obj_book->isbn = '1840224339';

// Write it to Datastore
$obj_book_store->upsert($obj_book);
```

Fetch all the Books from the Datastore and display their titles and ISBN numbers

```php
foreach($obj_book_store->fetchAll() as $obj_book) {
    echo "Title: {$obj_book->title}, ISBN: {$obj_book->isbn}", PHP_EOL;
}
```

These examples use the generic `GDS\Entity` class with a dynamic Schema. See [Defining Your Model](#defining-your-model) below for more details on custom Schemas and indexed fields.

### Demo App ###

A trivial guest book application

Application: http://php-gds-demo.appspot.com/

Code: https://github.com/tomwalder/php-gds-demo

## Getting Started ##

Are you sitting comfortably? before we begin, you will need: 
- a Google Account (doh)
- a Project to work on with the "Google Cloud Datastore API" turned ON [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- a "Service account" and a P12 key file for that service account [Service Accounts](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#serviceaccount)

### Composer, Dependencies ###

To install using composer, use this require line (for production)

`"tomwalder/php-gds": "v1.2.0"`

### Running the examples ###

You will need to create 2 files in the `examples/config` folder as follows
- `config.php` (you can use `_config.php` as a template)
- `key.p12`

Or, you can pass in your own `Google_Client` object, configured with whatever auth you like.

## Defining Your Model ##

Because Datastore is schemaless, the library also supports fields/properties that are not explicitly defined. But it often makes a lot of sense to define your Entity Schema up front.

Here is how we might build the Schema for our examples, with a Datastore Entity Kind of "Book" and 3 fields.

```php
$obj_schema = (new GDS\Schema('Book'))
   ->addString('title')
   ->addString('author')
   ->addString('isbn');
   
// The Store accepts a Schema object or Kind name as it's second parameter
$obj_book_store = new GDS\Store($obj_gateway, $obj_schema);
```

By default, fields are indexed. An indexed field can be used in a WHERE clause. You can explicitly configure a field to be not indexed by passing in `FALSE` as the second parameter to `addString()`.

If you use a dynamic schema (i.e. do not define on, but just use the Entity name) then all fields will be indexed for that record.

Avaialable Schema configuration methods:
- `GDS\Schema::addString`
- `GDS\Schema::addInteger`
- `GDS\Schema::addDatetime`
- `GDS\Schema::addFloat`
- `GDS\Schema::addBoolean`
- `GDS\Schema::addStringList`

Take a look at the `examples` folder for a fully operational set of code.

### Custom Entities and Stores ###

Whilst you can use the `GDS\Entity` and `GDS\Store` classes directly, as per the examples above, you may find it useful to extend both and have the extended Store contain the Schema definition.

For example

```php
class Book extends GDS\Entity { /* ... */ }
class BookStore extends GDS\Store { /* ... */ }
```

This way, when you pull objects out of Datastore, they are objects of your defined Entity class.

```php
$obj_store = new BookStore($obj_gateway);
$obj_book = $obj_store->fetchOne(); // $obj_book will be a "Book" object
```

Check out the examples folder for `Book.php` and `BookStore.php` code samples.

### Re-indexing ###

When you change a field from non-indexed to indexed you will need to "re-index" all your existing entities before they will be returned in queries run against that index by Datastore. This is due to the way Google update their BigTable indexes.

I've included a simple example (paginated) re-index script in the examples folder, `reindex.php`.

## Creating Records ##

### Alternative Array Syntax ###

There is an alternative to directly constructing a new `GDS\Entity` and setting it's member data, which is to use the `GDS\Store::createEntity` factory method as follows.

```php
$obj_book = $obj_book_store->createEntity([
    'title' => 'The Merchant of Venice',
    'author' => 'William Shakespeare',
    'isbn' => '1840224312'
]);
```

Support for DateTime object binding was added recently (also see query parameter binding below)

```php
$obj_book = $obj_book_store->createEntity([
    'title' => 'Some Book',
    'author' => 'A N Other Guy',
    'isbn' => '1840224313',
    'published' => new DateTime('-5 years')
]);
```

## Queries, GQL & The Default Query ##

At the time of writing, the `GDS\Store` object uses Datastore GQL as it's query language. Here is an example:

```php
$obj_book_store->fetchOne("SELECT * FROM Book WHERE isbn = '1853260304'");
```

And with support for named parameter binding (strings, integers)

 ```php
$obj_book_store->fetchOne("SELECT * FROM Book WHERE isbn = @isbnNumber", [
    'isbnNumber' => '1853260304'
]);
```

Support for DateTime object binding

 ```php
$obj_book_store->fetchOne("SELECT * FROM Task WHERE date_date < @now", [
    'now' => new DateTime()
]);
```

We provide a couple of helper methods for some common (root Entity) queries, single and batch  (much more efficient than many individual fetch calls):

- `GDS\Store::fetchById`
- `GDS\Store::fetchByIds` - batch fetching
- `GDS\Store::fetchByName`
- `GDS\Store::fetchByNames` - batch fetching

When you instantiate a store object, like `BookStore` in our example, it comes pre-loaded with a default GQL query of the following form (this is "The Default Query")

```sql
SELECT * FROM <Kind> ORDER BY __key__ ASC
```

Which means you can quickly and easily get one or many records without needing to write any GQL, like this:

```php
$obj_store->fetchOne();     // Gets the first book
$obj_store->fetchAll();     // Gets all books
$obj_store->fetchPage(10);  // Gets the first 10 books
```

### Pagination ###

When working with larger data sets, it can be useful to page through results in smaller batches. Here's an example paging through all Books in 50's.

```php
$obj_book_store->query('SELECT * FROM Book');
while($arr_page = $obj_book_store->fetchPage(50)) {
    echo "Page contains ", count($arr_page), " records", PHP_EOL;
}
```

#### Limits, Offsets & Cursors ####

In a standard SQL environment, the above pagination would look something like this:

- `SELECT * FROM Book LIMIT 0, 50` for the first page 
- `SELECT * FROM Book LIMIT 50, 50` for the second, and so on.

Although you can use a very similar syntax with Datastore GQL, it can be unnecessarily costly. This is because each row scanned when running a query is charged for. So, doing the equivalent of `LIMIT 5000, 50` will count as 5,050 reads - not just the 50 we actually get back.

This is all fixed by using Cursors. The implementation is all encapsulated within the `GDS\Gateway` class so you don't need to worry about it.

Bototm line: the bult-in pagination uses Cursors whenever possible for fastest & cheapest results.

#### Tips for LIMIT-ed fetch operations ####

Do not supply a `LIMIT` clause when calling 
- `GDS\Store::fetchOne` - it's done for you (we add `LIMIT 1`)
- `GDS\Store::fetchPage` - again, it's done for you and it will cause a conflict.

## Multi-tenant Applications & Data Namespaces ##

Google Datastore supports segregating data within a single "Dataset" using something called Namespaces.

Generally, this is intended for multi-tenant applications where each customer would have separate data, even within the same "Kind".

This library supports namespaces, and they are be configured per `Gateway` instance by passing in the optional 3rd namespace parameter.

<strong>ALL operations carried out through a Gateway with a namespace configured are done in the context of that namespace. The namespace is automatically applied to Keys when doing upsert/delete/fetch-by-key and to Requests when running GQL queries.</strong>

```php
// Create a store for a particular customer or 'application namespace'
$obj_client = GDS\Gateway::createGoogleClient(APP_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, KEY_FILE);
$obj_namespaced_gateway = new GDS\Gateway($obj_client, DATASET_ID, 'customer-namespace');
$obj_namespaced_book_store = new BookStore($obj_namespaced_gateway);
```

Further examples are included in the examples folder.

## Entity Groups, Hierarchy & Ancestors ##

Google Datastore allows for (and encourages) Entities to be organised in a hierarchy.

The hierarchy allows for some amount of "relational" data. e.g. a `ForumThread` entity might have one more more `ForumPosts` entities as children.

Entity groups are quite an advanced topic, but can positively affect your application in a number of areas including
 
- Transactional integrity
- Strongly consistent data

At the time of writing, I support working with entity groups through the following methods

- `GDS\Entity::setAncestry`
- `GDS\Entity::getAncestry`
- `GDS\Store::fetchEntityGroup`

## Transactions ##

The `GDS\Store` supports running updates and deletes in transactions.

To start a transaction

```php
$obj_store->beginTransaction();
```

Then, any operation that changes data will commit *and consume* the transaction. So an immediate call to another operation WILL NOT BE TRANSACTIONAL.

```php
// Data changed within a transaction
$obj_store->upsert($obj_entity);

// Not transactional
$obj_store->delete($obj_entity);
```

## Footnotes ##

I am certainly more familiar with SQL and relational data models so I think that may end up coming across in the code - rightly so or not!

I've been trying to decide if & what sort of Patterns this library contains. [PEAA](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/index.html). What I decided is that I'm not really following DataMapper or Repository to the letter of how they were envisaged. Probably it's closest to DataMapper.
